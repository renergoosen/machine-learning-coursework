# üìò Machine Learning Coursework

This repository contains coursework and mini-projects developed as part of my Machine Learning module during my final year at the University of Leeds.

Each project applies different machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets to explore the effectiveness of various models in predicting outcomes and making classifications.

## üîç Purpose

These projects were designed to apply core supervised learning techniques to a range of datasets. They reflect my growing interest in data science and machine learning and showcase my ability to apply different algorithms to solve practical, real-world problems.

The goal of these projects is not only to gain proficiency in common machine learning algorithms but also to understand how to select the most effective model for different types of problems.
